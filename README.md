# Tokenized Identity Attribute Verification (TIAV)

A blockchain-based system for secure, user-controlled identity verification and attribute management.

## Overview

TIAV is a decentralized identity verification framework that allows users to maintain control over their personal data while enabling trusted third parties to verify specific identity attributes without accessing unnecessary information. The system uses smart contracts to manage verification processes, data storage, consent, and audit trails.

## Core Components

### 1. Verifier Verification Contract

Validates and manages legitimate credential checkers within the ecosystem.

- **Verifier Registry**: Maintains a list of authorized verification entities
- **Reputation Scoring**: Tracks verifier trustworthiness and reliability
- **Challenge Mechanism**: Allows users to dispute verifier claims
- **Governance Controls**: Manages verifier onboarding and removal

### 2. Attribute Storage Contract

Securely manages identity claims with cryptographic proofs.

- **Encrypted Storage**: Keeps sensitive data protected on-chain
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enables verification without revealing actual data
- **Hash-Based Verification**: Uses cryptographic hashes for data validation
- **Attribute Categories**: Organizes identity data into logical groupings

### 3. Verification Request Contract

Handles third-party requests for identity confirmation.

- **Request Format**: Standardized schema for verification requests
- **Response Protocol**: Structured format for delivering verification results
- **Expiration Controls**: Time-based limits on verification validity
- **Request Filtering**: Prevents spam and unauthorized verification attempts

### 4. Consent Management Contract

Provides users with granular control over data sharing permissions.

- **Permission Registry**: Records user-granted sharing authorizations
- **Revocation Mechanism**: Allows users to withdraw permissions
- **Scope Limitations**: Restricts access to specific attributes only
- **Time-Bound Access**: Enables temporary verification permissions

### 5. Audit Trail Contract

Maintains immutable records of all identity verification activities.

- **Transaction Logging**: Records all verification events
- **Privacy Protection**: Maintains audit details without exposing sensitive data
- **Query Interface**: Allows authorized review of verification history
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates regulatory-friendly verification reports

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Local Environment**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tiav.git
   cd tiav
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Network Settings**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your blockchain network details
   ```

3. **Deploy Contracts**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:contracts
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Development Guidelines

- Use established identity standards (DID, Verifiable Credentials)
- Prioritize user privacy and consent in all interactions
- Minimize on-chain data storage where possible
- Follow security best practices for smart contract development
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage

## Security Considerations

- All contracts should undergo formal verification and auditing
- Implement proper access controls and permission checks
- Use secure cryptographic libraries for all operations
- Consider privacy implications of all data stored on-chain
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
